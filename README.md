# Fun with Hexadecimals!

## Practice counting in hex competitively

This was a project done for week 7 at Lighthouse Labs. The initial project wanted this to be a simple two-player adding game, summing two random numbers between 1 and 20.

I, being the person that I am, thought that adding in base-10 was boring and completely unchallenging.

Now you can practise adding randomly generated hexadecimals between #0a and #FF!

## To run the game:

This game runs in Ruby, so you'll have to have it installed (preferrably the latest version).

Once installed: fire up your terminal, clone the repo to your desired directory, grab a friend, and run `ruby main.rb`.

Have fun!
