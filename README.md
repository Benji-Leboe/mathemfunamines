# Fun with Hexadecimals!

## Practice counting in hex competitively

This was a project done for week 7 at Lighthouse Labs. The initial project wanted this to be a simple adding game, summing two random numbers between 1 and 20.

I, being the person that I am, thought that adding in base-10 was boring and completely unchallenging.

Now you can practise adding randomly generated hexadecimals between #0a and #FF!
